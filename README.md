# HW1

This readme file contains several instructions and clarifications for your first homework.
In order to work on your assignment please follow the instructions below as were also shown in the first workshop:

1) Activate Anaconda prompt.
2) Change the working directory to the directory where you chose to save the repository of HW1 using `cd <path of repo>`
3) If you do not work with mac computer, create the virtual environment (venv) using the command: `conda env create -f HW1.yml`

If you do work with mac, create your environment with HW1_expand.yml. In both cases, make sure that you are connected to some network when 
creating your venv.

4) Activate the environment using: `conda activate HW1`

Make sure that on the left side on your command line, your environment was changed from <base> to <HW1>.
    
5) Run Jupyter lab using the command: `jupyter lab`
    
Now, you can start working.
Notice, stage number 3 should only performed once. For other runs, you should just use `cd` to your repository and then activate the 
venv and run Jupyter lab.

Do not install any new packages in your venv.
The only locations where you should implement your code are in the modules `clean_data.py` and `lin_classifier.py` within the sections:
    
# ----------------Impelment your code here------------

# ----------------------------------------------------
    
Do not change the notebook itself unless you were asked for specifically within the notebook.
It is recommended to use PyCharm for debugging your code. You can use the cells written in HW1_main.
The only files for submission are: `HW1.ipynb`, `clean_data.py`, and `lin_classifier.py`.
Submission is individual.

GOOD LUCK!
